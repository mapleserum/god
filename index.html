   <h1>Lots of people talk about God</h1>
   <h2>But only a few of them know more than the name</h2>
   <h3>"What is God's life like," they wonder</h3>

   <ul>
    <li>of the pointing</li>
    <li>the way it looks</li>
    <li>the cracking of the image proves it is old</li>
   </ul>

   <p> Don't trust imitators. These are hoaxes:</p>
